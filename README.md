## Description

During the hackathon we created an App that allows you to push to talk in your own language and communicate with your peer in their own language.

This is being done in the following way:

- Using speech to text to recognize the sender voice message
- Translating the message using the Yandex translation service
- Sending the translated sentece to the receiver's phone
- Using text to speech to read the text message to the user.
